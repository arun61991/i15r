## How to contribute

### Bugs

Please report any errors to the [issue tracker][issue_tracker].

### Bug fixes

If you can submit a fix for a bug, then please fork the repository, and issue a pull request once done.

If the bug concerns the pattern matching or the replacing (text not replaced as it should be, or text
that should not replaced is) always submit a test to validate your fix against.

If it's not a bug and the fix is trivial, having a test is not an absolute necessity but you gets (lots of) bonus points.

### Enhancements, feature requests

The process is basically the same as for bug fixes. If you provide code that does what you'd like to see in the gem,
please issue a pull request. If you propose a feature, [open a ticket][issue_tracker].
