### 0.1

* DONE bug: In messages ending in punctuation (e.g No tags.) the punctuation is removed when replaced (e.g <%= I18n.t("users.show.no_tags") %>)

### 0.1.1

* DONE bug: indenting whitespace is removed around replaced messages
This is easy to fix, the whitespace has to be readded just like the punctuation

    <% tags = @photo.tag_list %>
      Tags:
    <% if !tags.blank? %>

    becomes

    <% tags = @photo.tag_list %><%= I18n.t("mysite.tags") %><% if !tags.blank? %>

### 0.2

* DONE title of links have to be internationailzed, e.g: <a title="Go back" href="...">
* DONE <%= f.label :body, "Question" %>
* DONE <%= label_tag :body, "Question" %>
* DONE <%= f.submit "Submit question" %>
* DONE <%= submit_tag "Submit question" %>
* DONE think about which rails helpers could be given text that needs to be internationalized (currently only link_to is scanned)
* DONE suppress printing of yaml strings (change by Alberto) when running the specs
* DONE make it possible to run i15r on several files

### 0.3.0

* DONE dry-run option: only show the diffs but do not actually overwrite the files

### 0.3.1

* haml matchers
  * DONE nothing is replaced in haml files although specs pass. Probably something related to receiving the whole file content as one blob of text and not as lines. It works with erb, though.
* sort out the ugly hierarchy, make it consistent (e.g add "erb" directory as there is a haml one), do not require files in lib by full path (e.g instead of require 'i15r/pattern\_matchers\_/haml/rails\_helper_matcher' => require 'haml/rails\_helper_matcher'), etc.

### 0.4.0

* DONE handle non-ascii characters properly (UTF-8 support) when replacing them. Ma√±ana should become I18n.t("prefix.manana"), for instance. That is, regular expressions should be utf-8 aware.

### 0.?

* make a PatternMatcher::Erb (and Haml) class that implements the run method and make the classes that now exist modules that these classes include/extend
* make the haml matchers nicer (was thrown together very hastily for a client project)
* make prefix not replace the inferred message string prefix, but really act as a prefix. (e.g if anetcom is given as a prefix, and the inferred message string is 'users.new' it should not be 'anetcom.name', but 'anetcom.users.new.name')
* write the necessary i18n strings back into the yaml file
* make interactive mode possible. the user is asked about each message to be replaced. he can choose to replace it, skip it or even edit it. Ideally the message would be shown in its context.
* make specs pass with ruby 1.8, see specs tagged with #1.8fail, probably the "weird characters" in the specs should be replaced by their unicode codes (e.g \u1234)
